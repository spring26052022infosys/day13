** subquery

** query nested in another query. 

** subquey should be written in ()

** subquery can be used in select, from, where, having clause

** subquery in select, from is rarely used

** subquery in select clause can return single value(single row & single column) and should have alias name
	for example fetching detailed and aggregate data together for each row
	the generated value is shown as additional attribute for each resultant row

** subquery in from clause is called as inline view and should have alias name
	subquery filters specified columns from the table which are used by parent query


** subquey in where, having are of two types
independent subquery, correlated subquery


** independent subquery

** inner and outer query can be executed independently

** independent subquery may reurn single row or multiple rows


** single row independent subquery uses = operator for comparison
	example with where clause
	SELECT Id, EName, Salary, Dept FROM Employee E1 WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee E2)

	example with having clause ( aggregate functions) nesting of aggregate functions can be upto 2 levels 
SELECT DEPT FROM Employee GROUP BY DEPT HAVING SUM(Salary) = (SELECT MAX(SUM(Salary)) FROM Employee GROUP BY Dept)

** multiple row independent subquery uses in operator   for comparison
SELECT CompId, Make, Model FROM Computer WHERE CompId IN (SELECT CompId FROM Employee);


** if independent subquery uses IN clause to fetch foreign keys from another table, it can be replaced by join.
SELECT C.CompId, Make, Model FROM Computer C, Employee E WHERE E.CompId = C.CompId


** if select caluse fetches data from columns of multiple tables then it can be written with join not subquery

** attributes from subquery cannot be accessed in outer query

** if where clause uses aggregate function then it can be written using subquery not join
